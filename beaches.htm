                Nusa Dua beach is a favourite of the local Indonesians because it is one of the cleanest beaches in Bali. This is mainly due to the multiple hotels located around the beach, allowing hotel visitors to stay at these luxurious 5 star hotels while enjoying a beautiful beach within walking distance. Besides hotels, one can find one of the best golf courses in Bali, a shopping center, a hospital, and a theater all within walking distance of the beach. </br></p>

                Jimbaran Beach is known for the restaurants that surrounds its shore. These restaurants offer amazing, fresh seafood caught just off the its beaches. The beach is also known for its white sand, which is difficult to find in bali; only in the most obscure locations can white sand be found (other than at Jimbaran Beach). The beach is located near the airport, and is often the first and last beach tourists would visit in Bali.</br></p>

                Arguably the most popular beach in Bali, Kuta is a must for all visitors. Located in the perfect spot for sunsets, Kuta is often crowded with tourists, local or international. Visitors can enjoy the day surfing on the beach, playing beach volleyball, throwing frisbees, or even sitting on the beach enjoying a massage, drawing a semi-permanent tattoo, and get your hair professionally braided.<br></p>

                    Like Jimbaran, this cliffside beach is also known for its white sands. Located in Badung, this beach is away from the center of Bali and is rarely visited by tourists. However, this makes it the perfect spot for those who want to avoid crowds but still enjoy the beautiful beaches of Bali. Visitors can also enjoy the view from the cliffs that look over the sea, a view that is not often found in other, more popular beaches in Bali. <br></p>
