                Tanah Lot is one of the, if not the, most popular temple in Bali. Located in Tabanan, Tanah Lot consists of two different temples: one onshore and one offshore temple. The main temple is offshore, and is placed on top of a rock/cliff formation connected by a pathway. During high tide, the main temple will be inaccessible and, instead, the onshore temple is used. Tanah Lot is the location for numerous legends and myths from Bali.  </br>

                    The name Goa Gajah directly translates into "Elephant Cave". This, however, can be misleading, as there are no elephants at the site. The name supposedly came because the cave was built for and dedicated to Hindy Lord Ganesh, who has the head of an elephant. Built in the 11th century, the site was first used for meditation. The site is located in Bedulu, West of Denpasar and approximately 1 hour away from the city.  <br>

                    Pura Taman Saraswati is a Balinese Hindu temple located in Ubud, and is dedicated to the goddess Sarasvati. The temple is well known for its lotus pond which can be found on either side of the path towards the temple. Despite being one of the most popular religious sites in the city, the entrance to Pura Taman Saraswati is free. However, like every temple in Bali, it is required that visitors wear a sash and sarong. There are also evening performances starting from 7:30pm featuring Bali's traditional dance.  <br>
